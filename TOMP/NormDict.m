function D = NormDict( D, delta );
% NormDict normalizes a given dictionary
%  
% Usage:    D = NormDict( D, delta );
%           D = NormDict( D );
%
% Inputs:
%   D       non-normalized dictionary
%   delta   parameter, the discrete norm of D is multiplied by sqrt(delta) 
%           (default value is 1)  
% Outputs:
%   D       normalized dictionary
%
% Remark: It normalizes the columns of matrix D.
